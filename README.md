# Description 

Piggy Profiles & Pics Hub is a website for guinea pig owners or just a guinea pig lover to register and add their own pet.
Once added people can like the pet and if it gets the most likes it will come first in the row on the home page.
Even if the user don't have a guinea pig can still register and check out the other guinea pigs and read about different breeds.
It's basically a database where users can show their guinea pig with a photo and description.

## UX

The homepage effectively displays profiles with images and key details (breed, age, character) in a grid layout. This helps users quickly look and identify guinea pigs that they like.
The layout adjusts well to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both desktops and mobile devices.The primary navigation menu includes essential links (Home, Log In, Register) making it easy for users to find and access these features.Each guinea pig profile provides relevant information such as breed, age, character traits, and ownerâ€™s name.
The design is straightforward, allowing users to browse profiles without unnecessary steps.

### Colour Scheme

- `#c6b6a7` used for primary color.
- `#e7d3c3` used for secondary color.
- `#d7b3a1` used for tertiery color.
- `#342719` used for primary text color.
- `#00796b` used for button color.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/c6b6a7-e7d3c3-d7b3a1-342719-00796b) to generate my colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/colors.png)

I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
    
    --main-color: #c6b6a7;
    --secondary-color: #e7d3c3;
    --tertiery-color: #d7b3a1;
    --text-color-primary: #342719;
    --secondary-text-color: #000000;
    --button-color: #00796b;
    --button-hover: #0d6357;
}
```

### Typography

- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for all the other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the ones in the Register/Login form and Add and Edit pet form.

## Database Design

My project uses a non-relational database with MongoDB, and therefore the database architecture
doesn't have actual relationships like a relational database would.

My database is called **guineaPigsDB**.

It contains 3 collections:

- **breeds**
    | Key | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | _id | ObjectId() | |
    | pet_breed | String | |
    | info | String | |
    | breed_image | String | |

- **pets**
    | Key | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | _id | ObjectId() | |
    | pet_name | String | |
    | pet_age | String | |
    | pet_breed | String | selected from *breeds* collection |
    | pet_character | String | |
    | image_url | String | |
    | owner | String | selected from the *users* collection |

- **users**
    | Key | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | _id | ObjectId() | |
    | username | String | |
    | password | String | uses Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) |

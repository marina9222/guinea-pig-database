# Description 

Piggy Profiles & Pics Hub is a website for guinea pig owners or just a guinea pig lover to register and add their own pet.
Once added people can like the pet and if it gets the most likes it will come first in the row on the home page.
Even if the user don't have a guinea pig can still register and check out the other guinea pigs and read about different breeds.
It's basically a database where users can show their guinea pig with a photo and description.

## UX

The homepage effectively displays profiles with images and key details (breed, age, character) in a grid layout. This helps users quickly look and identify guinea pigs that they like.
The layout adjusts well to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both desktops and mobile devices.The primary navigation menu includes essential links (Home, Log In, Register) making it easy for users to find and access these features.Each guinea pig profile provides relevant information such as breed, age, character traits, and ownerâ€™s name.
The design is straightforward, allowing users to browse profiles without unnecessary steps.

### Colour Scheme

- `#c6b6a7` used for primary color.
- `#e7d3c3` used for secondary color.
- `#d7b3a1` used for tertiery color.
- `#342719` used for primary text color.
- `#00796b` used for button color.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/c6b6a7-e7d3c3-d7b3a1-342719-00796b) to generate my colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/colors.png)

I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
    
    --main-color: #c6b6a7;
    --secondary-color: #e7d3c3;
    --tertiery-color: #d7b3a1;
    --text-color-primary: #342719;
    --secondary-text-color: #000000;
    --button-color: #00796b;
    --button-hover: #0d6357;
}
```

### Typography

- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for all the other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the ones in the Register/Login form and Add and Edit pet form.

## Database Design

My project uses a non-relational database with MongoDB, and therefore the database architecture
doesn't have actual relationships like a relational database would.

My database is called **guineaPigsDB**.

It contains 3 collections:

- **breeds**
    | Key | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | _id | ObjectId() | |
    | pet_breed | String | |
    | info | String | |
    | breed_image | String | |

- **pets**
    | Key | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | _id | ObjectId() | |
    | pet_name | String | |
    | pet_age | String | |
    | pet_breed | String | selected from *breeds* collection |
    | pet_character | String | |
    | image_url | String | |
    | owner | String | selected from the *users* collection |

- **users**
    | Key | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | _id | ObjectId() | |
    | username | String | |
    | password | String | uses Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) |

```mermaid
erDiagram
    breeds {
        ObjectId _id
        String pet_breed
        String info
        String breed_image
    }
    pets {
        ObjectId _id
        String pet_name
        String pet_age
        String pet_breed
        String pet_character
        String image_url
        String owner
    }
    users {
        ObjectId _id
        String username
        String password
    }

    breeds ||--o{ pets : "pet_breed"
    users ||--o{ pets : "owner"
```

## Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.


## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://flask-guinea-pig-database-ccd8a0a6a383.herokuapp.com).

### MongoDB Non-Relational Database

This project uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) for the Non-Relational Database.

To obtain your own MongoDB Database URI, sign-up on their site, then follow these steps:

- The name of the database on MongoDB should be called **insert-your-database-name-here**.
- The collection(s) needed for this database should be **insert-your-collection-names-here**.
- Click on the **Cluster** name created for the project.
- Click on the **Connect** button.
- Click **Connect Your Application**.
- Copy the connection string, and replace `password` with your own password (also remove the angle-brackets).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `IP` | 0.0.0.0 |
| `MONGO_DBNAME` | user's own value |
| `MONGO_URI` | user's own value |
| `PORT` | 5000 |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile
- runtime.txt

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`
- *replace **app.py** with the name of your primary Flask app name; the one at the root-level*

The **runtime.txt** file needs to know which Python version you're using:
1. type: `python3 --version` in the terminal.
2. in the **runtime.txt** file, add your Python version:
	- `python-3.9.19`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

If you are using SQLAlchemy for your project, you need to create a local PostgreSQL database.
In this example, the example database name is **db-name**.

```shell
workspace (branch) $ set_pg
workspace (branch) $ psql

... connection to postgres ...

postgres=# CREATE DATABASE db-name;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=# \c db-name;
You are now connected to database "db-name" as user "foobar".
db-name=# \q
```

Once that database is created, you must migrate the database changes from your models.py file.
This example uses **app-name** for the name of the primary Flask application.

```shell
workspace (branch) $ python3

... connection to Python CLI ...

>>> from app-name import db
>>> db.create_all()
>>> exit()
```

To confirm that the database table(s) have been created, you can use the following:

```shell
workspace (branch) $ psql -d db-name

... connection to postgres ...

postgres=# \dt

	List of relations
Schema | Name | Type | Owner
-------+------+------+--------
public | blah1 | table | foobar
public | blah2 | table | foobar
public | blah3 | table | foobar

db-name=# \q
```

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps, plus a few extras.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")


os.environ.setdefault("DB_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", "True")
```

If using Flask-Migrate, make sure to include the following steps as well.

During the course of development, it became necessary to update the PostgreSQL data models.
In order to do this, [Flask-Migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io) was used.

- `pip3 install Flask-Migrate`
- Import the newly installed package on your main `__init__.py` file:
	- `from flask_migrate import Migrate`
- Define **Migrate** in the same file after **app** and **db** are defined:
	- `migrate = Migrate(app, db)`
- Initiate the migration changes in the terminal:

```shell
workspace (branch) $ flask db init

	... generating migrations ...

workspace (branch) $ set_pg
workspace (branch) $ flask db migrate -m "Add a commit message for this migration"

	... migrating changes ...

workspace (branch) $ flask db upgrade

	... updating database ...
```
